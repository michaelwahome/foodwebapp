#The Burger Joint Online Ordering System

This is a web application that allows customers to login order food from The Burger Joint (a fictional restaurant) via the internet. It also allows administrators to view and manipulate various system information from the backend, such as the items on the menu and the orders made by various users.

It is an individual project that was made as a part of my coursework for Web Application Development, a second year unit in my Bachelor's of Informatics and Computer Science course. It is made using Vanilla PHP and is yet to be completed.
